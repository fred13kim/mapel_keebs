## The Board

### Thoughts
As I proceed through this project, I believe documenting/recording my progress would benefit not only the reader, but also myself in developing this board.

### Inspiration
This project was heavily inspired by the following:
- ZeFyr "Vermillion" J. (creator of VE.A)
- taehatypes (the sheen ì‹  of keyboards ofc)
- jvscholz (for maximum productivity)
- Gondolindrim (a Brazilian engineer who inspired me to start my own kbd projects)
